# install and start mariadb server

install on fedora23 : `dnf install mariadb-server`
start the server    : `systemctl start mariadb`

# Logging in

To connect to MariaDB, type:

```sh
mysql -u username -p -h host databasename
```

* Replace username with your database username. If your database username is the same as your computer login name, you can leave the `-u username` argument off. 
* Leave out `-h host` out if the copy of MariaDB that you want to access is on the same machine as you. If not, replace host with the ip or hostname of the database server (if the server is on the local host you can also enter 'localhost). 
* Replace databasename with the name of the database you want to access (such as test, which comes already created for testing purposes). 

login the first time: `mysql test`
